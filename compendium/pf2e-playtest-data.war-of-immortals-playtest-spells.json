			"name": "Earth's Bile",
			"description": "<p>Your apparition is a conduit for the earth's molten blood, unleashing a devastating burst of lava at your command.

			"name": "Embodiment of Battle",
			"description": "<p>Your apparition guides your attacks and imparts its skill to your movements. For the duration, your proficiency with martial weapons is equal to your proficiency with simple weapons, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls made with weapons or unarmed attacks, you gain the Reactive Strike reaction, and you gain the critical specialization effect for any weapon you are wielding when you Cast or Sustain this Spell. The instincts of an apparition of battle run contrary to the use of magic; for the duration of this spell, you take a –2 status penalty to your spell attack modifier and your spell DCs.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> The status bonus to attack and damage rolls granted by this spell is increased to +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The status bonus to attack and damage rolls granted by this spell is increased to +3.</p>"

			"name": "River Carving Mountains",
			"description": "<p>Your apparition solidifies around you into roaring water and spraying mist. For the duration of this spell, you have lesser cover against ranged attacks and gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds. Once per turn, you can use an action to Stride up to your speed while your apparition fills each square you pass through with the lingering energy of a coursing river. These squares become difficult terrain until the start of your next turn. You can use <em>river carving mountains</em> while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.</p>"

		"Trickster's Mirrors": {
			"name": "Trickster's Mirrors",
			"description": "<p>You are surrounded by up to 3 mirrors that reflect twisted and distorted images of you, making it hard to tell where you actually are within your space and potentially causing those who attack you to hit one of the mirrors instead. You start with one mirror and gain an additional mirror each time you Sustain this spell, up to a maximum of three mirrors. Any attack that would hit you has a random chance of hitting one of your mirrors instead of you. With one mirror, the chances are 1 in 2 (1–3 on [[/r 1d6]]). With two mirrors, there is a 1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1–2 on 1d6). With three mirrors, there is a 1 in 4 chance of hitting you (1 on [[/r 1d4]]).</p>\n<p>Once a mirror is hit, it is destroyed. If an attack roll fails to hit your AC but doesn't critically fail, it destroys a mirror. If the attacker was within 5 feet, it must succeed at a basic Will save or take 1d4 mental damage as it believes itself cut by a shower of glass shards from the breaking mirror. A damaging effect that affects all targets within your space (such as a caustic blast) destroys all of the mirrors.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The mental damage dealt by a broken mirror increases by [[/r 1d4]].</p>"
